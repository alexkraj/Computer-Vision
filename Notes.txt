Improve disparity calculation
crop out an element of the image if the detection is getting a little confused	

Qualitative evidence of performance - based on a dataset of N examples, this approach works X% of the time for detections of Y regions

Quantitative evidence of performance - examples of it working

Script must display the colour image AND the disparity image as it runs	
- Can keep in the same window

TODO: for challenging conditions
- masks to stop confusion
- filleting the disparity 
- help difficult conditions

DECISIONS:
- Changing the disparity noise filter size
- removing drawing/expensive calculations for items we were not looking for
- mask to ignore the car itself
- distance calculation of the means of the box in the disparity
- added masks to the disparity calculation
